2023-07-05,Pennsylvania,I just wanted to go out of my way to recognize a Starbucks employee Billy at the Franklin Park location! I was running late to work & placed an order at the wrong location and not only did he make my order with a smile he made it within 60 seconds! Thank you SOO much I was having a bad morning and people like you just make this world a better place.,5.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_804950_thumbnail.jpg,
2023-01-22,Oregon,I’m on this kick of drinking 5 cups of warm water. I work for Instacart right now and every location of Starbucks I was given free hot water because I asked for it without being charged. I really appreciate Starbucks for giving me the opportunity to do such thing. That’s why I give them five stars. They fully have my support. They’re super nice and professional and the coffee is great. Go to Starbucks.,5.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_793785_thumbnail.jpeg,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_793787_thumbnail.jpg
2023-07-27,California,"I filed a BBB complaint last month because Starbucks canceled my Starbucks Reward cards. I couldn't remember the balances, so I guessed about $9. Starbucks played nothing but games and tried everything they could to avoid responding to the complaint. I received a couple of phone call messages asking me to contact them directly and discuss the matter. The number provided was the customer service number and when I spoke with one representative, Linda hung up the phone on me. I did not use my card since 2012 which is my prerogative. Because of this and other reasons, Starbucks decided to close my Starbucks account. I reopened one about a few weeks ago and added a new card that I have not used yet.",1.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_806740_thumbnail.jpg,
2023-05-22,Texas,"This past Sunday, 5/21/2023 we went through the drive in and bought 2 Double smoked breakfast sandwiches, expecting it to have back and Gruyere cheese and an egg. They did not. We got 2 buns pasted together with unidentifiable something. We were on the road somewhere or I would have turned around and returned them. I know their food comes pre packaged and only warmed at the store, so I fault the company for falsely selling food that does not meet the picture on display at the ordering kiosk. Just how many millions does Starbucks need to make on a daily basis? Their food is already overpriced. I mean, how much does 1 egg, 1 small slices of bacon and cheese cost?",1.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_801697_thumbnail.jpeg,
2022-11-17,California,"Starbucks had an ad on Veterans Day for complimentary coffee for Vets. I go to Starbucks at least once a day and my Sherman Oaks location didn’t know about it. I called corporate, who confirmed it was a fake ad. I asked my San Diego Marines about it, and they advised Starbucks was honoring it. I went online to contact Starbucks, and they said they’d look into it, call me back, and even looked on my account and said they would gift me $10. ALL WAS A LIE. I was never contacted, didn’t receive the $10 (unimportant), and reached out this morning and was hung up on. Starbucks has lost a loyal life long customer. I will also tell every veteran I know that Starbucks does not honor service members and they have no integrity. Disappointing!!!",1.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_789669_thumbnail.jpeg,
2022-02-23,Pennsylvania,I ordered 2 mint Frappuccino and it was not frozen. I returned to the facility and an Asian guy looked very upset. He redone my drinks and he still could not make it correct. He forgot to add the chocolate syrup and was told and he snatched it off the counter with attitude! And he added cookie crumbs not the syrup. He made me feel very uncomfortable! On top of that I tried it and it was not good. I do not recommend this location at Washington Square. If you see this guy do not let him make your drink!,1.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_745719_thumbnail.jpg,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_745722_thumbnail.jpg

2020-02-21,California,"I normally buy my Grande Pike at this Starbucks: 138 S Central Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90012. Today I decided to add bagel and cream cheese to complete my breakfast. I left and had to go back asap because the cream cheese given to me was an opened and used one. I asked for the Manager and she accommodated me but I had to say my piece to Chris who served me. I told him what was he even thinking about???? With all the plague all over the world why would you do that. He apologized but it never affected me because I don't know why he did that. Asked him why give me somebody else cream cheese??? What if it is contaminated. So how can I trust Starbucks now. Is that the training you have for your employees??? It is so Disgusting. I wish I could attach a picture of the  cream cheese. So consumers check what you buy all the time.",1.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_543635_thumbnail.jpg,
2019-07-31,Texas,Bought the cocoa cloud in a couple of locations and man what a waste of money. The last drink I got was 80-85% foam. This has been the trend.

2018-11-09,California,"I have enjoyed Starbucks for years as well as the free wifi. Currently I am homeless and utilize the free internet Starbucks on Foothill Blvd, in Pomona California provides. Until now. Starbucks has called the police on myself and my boyfriend several times. I assumed for being in the parking lot a little too long or because our van is a bit of an eyesore with all of our things piled on top.

2018-03-21,California,"On Friday March 16th around 3:30 pm I went to Starbucks drive-through on 800 Oakdale Rd., Modesto. I ordered a drink that was supposed to nonfat milk, but they gave me a drink that contained Almond milk. I am highly allergic to almond milk and I had to take emergency actions after taking one drink. The cup was not labeled or written on as their usual procedure. When I went back inside they said “oh sorry we gave you the car's drink that was behind. Here’s yours.” I informed them of the seriousness of their mistake. My hives have finally cleared up. I reported it to Starbucks and I have a case number. They need a policy to ensure they give customers the right order which could be simply restating the order before they hand it to the customer outside the drive-through window.",1.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_225457_thumbnail.jpeg,
2017-12-03,Missouri,"Absolutely adore Starbucks coffee, whether bagged, brewed or K-cups. I sometimes have to wait five minutes for a 'pour over' since I often order decaf or 1/2 caf. That I don't understand, especially since it's late afternoon or early evening, when decaf would be needed. However, the coffee is wonderful, service done with a smile and the store atmosphere is welcoming.",4.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_191939_thumbnail.jpg,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_191942_thumbnail.jpg
2015-09-23,Texas,"I ordered Caramel Frappuccino from the Starbucks inside the store and found a very long hair hanging inside the cup.

2015-07-25,California,"I enjoy my coffee everyday. Unfortunately it has to be decaf latte. $3.00/day and with friends goes usually $20.00 bucks. I don't have problem with that, like I said. But I visited the store # 11233 in la 7/23/15 @ 4:47 pm. So, I was going to pay with $100.00 bill & the guy told me that he was not going to honor my money with no reason or apology. He just said no & he sent me to another store to change my bill. I had my kids with me. So I was unable to use my street language. I felt so bad. I can't believe how those people are trained. With no customer service skill @ all. I'm very confident that they lost my business. I have to visit another coffee shop from now on.",1.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_31928_thumbnail.jpg,
2013-12-05,Minnesota,"Had a few bad experiences at a local Starbucks, 3 out of the last 5 drinks were wrong. So I wrote a complaint to Starbucks customer relations. About a day later I got an email, that even said they would look into the service at at location. About 2 weeks later, I got a letter and 2 free drink cards sent. I definitely think it's a step in the right directions, some locations have offered great service and this location continued to provide subpar even at times bad service. The reply although won't fix the location, it's a hope it might and definitely more than I have ever received from McDonald's, the 10s of times I've complaint about a particular location, primarily the one right next to my house. So yes all in all the overall customer service I have received from Starbucks have been positive. Attached the letter and coupons, had to cut of the top half of the letter, because my name is in it and unfortunately it also cropped out the Starbucks header.",4.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_7299_thumbnail.jpg,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_7300_thumbnail.jpg
2013-07-18,Texas,"I have been having issues with this STARBUCKS location in Humble TX 1501 FM1960. I always order my coffee at 110 degree so it is not too hot for me to drink. There is one particular person who always makes it too hot. This time it was very hot and I was unaware because of the out shield holder. So I took a big drink and scalded my mouth and throat and spitted out the coffee all over my car and spilled the other portion on my lap. I turned my car around to tell them something. When I approached the girl she said it has nothing to do with her and I have nothing to complain about. I became very angry and told her this better not ever happen again. Then once more she gave my wife and I another incident. This time I called the Starbucks number and notified the regional manager and they told me they would send me a $25 gift card. However, this is not justice... This girl owes my wife and I a sincere apology or she should be fired.",1.0,https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_4900_thumbnail.jpg,
2012-11-06,California,"I always go to the Starbucks in Oakland, on Hegenberger, and I've never really had an issue with service until last night! The Barista ** was rude to me and my children! She seemed very detached from her responsibilities and ability to be friendly. Usually when I come, I only see two girls, ** and **, who are both very sweet and willing to do what it takes to satisfy me and kids. ** always puts a really big smile on my kids’ faces and mine. She's a really sweet girl. Unfortunately she was off tonight. But last night, my kids asked for pastries and ** (""Person in charge?"") ignored my son, due to her deep concern with texting. She never even acknowledged him standing there. ** later helped him. I studied for some time to overhear the night shift complaining about the job to a guy who came in. If she hates her own manager and the way she's treated here, why not quit? It will probably do us good customers some justice! ",1.0,,
2016-06-22,California,Well I'm always trying new things. I love Starbucks and I'm one of the ones that would always be pissed off for tooo much ice and no foam in my drinks but I would always watch them like a hawk and tell them exactly how I like it. But I went in tonight to get a new drink. I kind of knew it was a waste of time just because how much different can it really be from what they have already. So whatever I tried it and omg never again will I try something new from them again. Very disgusting. The drink was horrible. The service was awesome. I got the youth berry and the caramel one. Horrible and $5 each - waste of money. I could have gone next door and got a frozen lemonade from Wendy's for $3 and it would have tasted better.,1.0,,

2015-05-14,California,"We are in hard times as it is and a cup of Starbucks coffee is the most expensive coffee around. That said, I pulled up to a Starbucks drive thru and saw a tip jar hanging out the take out window and thought to myself, ""No way, I must be hallucinating"". I'm seeing way too many tip jars as it is everywhere I go and it sickens me. It's equal to a person saying,""hey if you don't tip me, you are not as cool as the people that do"". Look, I gladly tip at restaurants because it's a way to establish how one is to be treated. Plus, there are other people involved other than the waitress such as the bus boy, etc... ",1.0,,

2014-12-20,California,"My husband disabled has brain damage as well as some physical disabilities from a car crash. He also happens to be Mexican American. Neither are acceptable it seems to the fine people of Starbucks on Feland and Shaw in Fresno Ca. One day my husband and I sit outside of Starbucks and I go in to make our order and I am standing in line when I hear an Anglo woman complaining about immigrants to one of the Starbucks baristas who to my dismay is totally agreeing with this racist old lady. I felt embarrassed as I am Spanish and felt it was inappropriate. Well I'm waiting for a while in line when my husband knocks on the window to change his drink request with me. Its a hundred and ten degrees outside so he is sweating like mad, also a result of his disability. Well the female blonde haired barista looks at him in horror and says to the racist Anglo lady, ""There's one of them now."" She meant immigrants these two Anglo females were complaining about. She turns to me with this look of hate and condescension and screeches, ""TELL HIM TO PUT HIS SHIRT BACK ON!""

I had asked the cashier to put 100.00 on the gift card. The cashier charged me 200.00 instead. Sadly, I didn't realize it until the following day when I checked my bank account and noticed the amount, at which point, I checked the receipt and surely, it was for 200.00.

I waited patiently for my coffee as did everyone else but my frappe tasted like crap! I don't drink Starbucks very often and if I do I go to the one on military and never had an issue there whatsoever l! BUT TODAY, I happen to be in the town east area and decided to treat myself to a frappe!

Since when does a store manager dictate the policies for the district? On that same day, she served me coffee and a brownie a half hour before the cop showed up. She set me up. Before that happened, I was regular loyal customer, and I told my friends and relatives about this incident. They are going to cut up their gold cards.The worst part of this was that the fool manager and the cop yelled at me to get out of the store and the idiot cop did not want to hear my side. I was humiliated in front of the employees and the customers, and that moron, the district manager, won't help me and she loves her. I believe nobody at Starbucks will help me.
